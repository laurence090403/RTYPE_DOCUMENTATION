# Get Started with R-TYPE: Your Epic Space Adventure Begins üöÄ

Welcome to the world of R-TYPE, an iconic Horizontal Shmup (Shoot‚Äôem‚Äôup) game that captured the hearts of gamers in the '90s. In this project, you have the exciting opportunity to create your own version of R-TYPE, adding new dimensions to the classic gameplay.

## What is R-TYPE? üïπÔ∏è

The project aims to develop a multithreaded server and a graphical client in C++ for the video game R-Type, using a custom-designed game engine. R-Type is a popular horizontal shoot'em up game from the 90s, and in this project, we will create a networked version of the game where one to four players will be able to fight the enemy Bydos together. The internal design of the game should demonstrate architectural patterns of a real game engine. The project will be implemented using CMake as the build tool, and all relevant source files, excluding unnecessary files such as binaries, temporary files, and object files, should be included in the delivery. The project will be divided into two phases: first, developing the core architecture of the game to create a functional prototype, and then expanding several aspects of the prototype to the next level by exploring specialized areas of choice from a list of proposed options.
