For example, you might choose ".NET desktop build tools" or "Web development build tools." You can also choose individual components if you prefer a more customized installation.

    8-After selecting the workloads and components, click the "Install" button to start the installation process. You may need to accept the license terms during this process.

    9- The installer will begin downloading and installing the selected components. This process may take some time, depending on your internet connection speed and the selected components.

    10- Once the installation is complete, you can use the Build Tools for Visual Studio from the command line or integrate them into your preferred development environment.

It's important to note that the Build Tools for Visual Studio provide command-line tools and compilers without the Visual Studio IDE. They are designed for scenarios where you only need the build-related tools and not the full development environment.


- install C++ dependencies and cmake in visual studio

To install C++ dependencies and CMake in Visual Studio, you can follow these steps:

    1- Open Visual Studio and go to the "Extensions" menu.

    2- Select "Manage Extensions" from the dropdown menu. This will open the Extensions and Updates window.

    3- In the search bar of the Extensions and Updates window, type "C++" and press Enter.

    4- Look for the "C++ Desktop Development" extension and click on the "Download" button next to it.

    5- Wait for the extension to be downloaded and installed. You may need to restart Visual Studio after the installation is complete.

    6- Once Visual Studio restarts, go to the "File" menu and select "New" and then "Project". This will open the New Project window.

    7- In the New Project window, expand the "Installed" templates on the left-hand side and select "Visual C++".

    8- Choose a project template that suits your needs, such as "Console Application" or "Windows Desktop Application". Select the template and click "Next".

    9- Configure the project settings as desired, and click on the "Create" button to create the project.

    10- Once the project is created, you can start adding C++ code files to it.

    11- To use CMake in Visual Studio, you can either create a new project with CMake support or add CMake support to an existing project.

        To create a new project with CMake support:
            Go to the "File" menu and select "New" and then "Project".
            In the New Project window, expand the "Installed" templates on the left-hand side and select "C++".
            Select the "CMake Project" template and click "Next".
            Configure the project settings and click on the "Create" button to create the project.

        To add CMake support to an existing project:
            Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Add" and then "New Item".
            In the Add New Item window, search for "CMake" in the search bar.
            Select the "CMake Settings" item and click "Add".

    12- Once you have a project with CMake support, you can configure your CMakeLists.txt file to specify the dependencies and build settings for your project.

        Open the CMakeLists.txt file in your project.
        Use the CMake commands and syntax to configure your project's dependencies, include directories, libraries, and build options.

    13- Build your project by selecting "Build" from the Visual Studio menu or pressing Ctrl+Shift+B.

That's it! You have now installed C++ dependencies and CMake in Visual Studio, and you can start developing C++ projects using these tools.
