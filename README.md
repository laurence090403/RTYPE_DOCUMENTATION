## Introduction :checkered_flag  üöÄ:

The project aims to develop a multithreaded server and a graphical client in C++ for the video game R-Type, using a custom-designed game engine. R-Type is a popular horizontal shoot'em up game from the 90s, and in this project, we will create a networked version of the game where one to four players will be able to fight the enemy Bydos together. The internal design of the game should demonstrate architectural patterns of a real game engine. The project will be implemented using CMake as the build tool, and all relevant source files, excluding unnecessary files such as binaries, temporary files, and object files, should be included in the delivery. The project will be divided into two phases: first, developing the core architecture of the game to create a functional prototype, and then expanding several aspects of the prototype to the next level by exploring specialized areas of choice from a list of proposed options.


### From sources

clone the project

```shell
git clone git@github.com:EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-COT-5-1-rtype-yannick.keke.git
```

launch cmake

```shell
cmake -S . -B ./build/
```

then make

```shell
cd build/
make
```

and the project is finally ready to launch

### DEV_DOCUMENTATION

Visit our DEV Documentation [here](https://laurence090403.github.io/RTYPE_DOCUMENTATION/)

### Usage :clipboard:

Make sure you have [cmake](https://cmake.org/install/) installed

## STEP1: Compile on Linux

```shell
- pip install conan
- conan profile detect --force
- conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
- make
- root of the project run the binaries
```

## STEP2: Compile on Windows

```shell

- install Visual studio
- install buildtools of visual studio
- install C++ dependencies and cmake in visual studio
- install conan
- conan profile detect --force
- conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=. ..
- cmake --build . --config Release
- root of the project run the binaries
- these are the binaries: r-type_server.exe and r-type_client.exe
```

## STEP3: CPACK TO ZIP AND BUILD THE PROJECT

CMake has a corresponding meta package system CPack, which generates configuration files for numerous packaging systems. Distributing code and binary executablees and libraries to users without requiring them to compile a project is done via these packages. CPack creates these binary packages like Windows .msi, Linux .deb/.rpm, MacOS .dmg, etc. CPack also creates traditional source archives as are also generated by GitHub Releases, but with fine-grained control of the contents.

Assuming the PROJECT_BINARY_DIR is ‚Äúbuild‚Äù, CPack generates build/CPackConfig.cmake for binary packages and build/CPackSourceConfig.cmake for source packages. CPackConfig.cmake is generated according to install() commands in the CMakeLists.txt files of the project.

Note that in general ‚Äúinstall()‚Äù DESTINATION should always use relative paths. CPack ignores install() items with absolute DESTINATION.

CPackSourceConfig.cmake works the opposite way‚Äìit includes everything not excluded by CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES, so we make a file cmake/.cpack_ignore with regex excluding non-source files. As a last step at the end of the main CMakeLists.txt after all install(), we include cmake/cpack.cmake.

Run this script (builder.sh) at the root of the project:

```shell
./builder.sh
```

It will create a package folder at the root of the project. This folder contain a R-Type-0.1.1-Source.tar.bz2 file.
To unzip it run this command:

```shell
tar -xvf R-Type-0.1.1-Source.tar.bz2
```

This command will create a R-Type-0.1.1-Source folder which contain all the ressources of our project. Enjoy the game üéÆ

# To launch the server:

```shell
./r_type_server  <address> <port> <lobby_status>
```
Now, the clients could connect to the server

To launch the client:

```shell
./r_type_client  <address> <port> <sound> <lobby_status>
```

Enjoy the gameplay, and tell your friends to join you ! :tada:

## Game :video_game:

R-Type is a horizontal shoot'em up game where players control a spaceship and navigate through levels filled with enemies and obstacles. The goal is to destroy enemies, avoid enemy fire, and reach the end of each level to confront a boss. The game features a player's ship with horizontal and vertical movement capabilities and the ability to shoot projectiles. Various types of enemies, including enemy ships, drones, and turrets, attack the player with projectiles or specific movement patterns. Levels also contain obstacles like asteroids, structures, and barriers that players must navigate through. Power-ups can be collected to temporarily enhance the player's abilities. At the end of each level, a boss battle awaits, requiring strategic approaches to defeat massive enemies with powerful attacks. In the networked version, multiple players can collaborate to fight enemies together, adding a cooperative element to the gameplay. The ultimate objective is to progress through levels, defeat enemies, and save the galaxy from the Bydos enemy threat.

## Architecture :factory:

Our game is divided into two major parts and two major libraries: the client and the server, as well as our network and ECS (Entity Component System) library.

The client and the server use the libraries we have developed, but let's go into the details of the libraries.

Check our schema

### Entity Component System 

Entity Component System (ECS) is a software architectural pattern mostly used in video game development for the representation of game world objects. An ECS comprises entities composed from components of data, with systems which operate on entities' components.

ECS follows the principle of composition over inheritance, meaning that every entity is defined not by a type hierarchy, but by the components that are associated with it. Systems act globally over all entities which have the required components.

## Network UDP & TCP Protocol

The network library is the package that allows the different clients to communicate with the server and to play with their friends.

The principle is simple: you connect in TCP to our Lobby, which like a load balancer manages several game servers that use the UDP protocol.

If you want more information, check the doc about the protocol

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
